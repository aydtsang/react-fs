# Initializing Project

1. Create `next-app` with experimental features (i.e. `app` directory and route handlers)

```
pnpm create next-app --experimental-app
```

2. Remove all of the files that come with the example so that we have the basics (i.e. remove static resources, styles, fonts, components, etc.)

3. Test the server to see if it's running (check `/` and `/api/hello`)
```
pnpm dev
```

# What's up with tables?
